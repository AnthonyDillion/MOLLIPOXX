  <!-- 
  You're missing the basic structure for meaningful page layout.
  
  Where is the .wrapper, <header>, and <main>? You can't make a grid if you don't have containing boxes to move around. 
  
  Your PDF handout packet has several template page layout examples and you can take inspiration from the assignments we did during the semester. 

  Your HTML page file name should be meaningfully related to their content. Not generic names like "link2"

   <section> <!-- why doesn't this have a class name? -->
   <h1>MOLLIPOXX</h1> <!-- this should be in a <header> -->
